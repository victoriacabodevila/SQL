Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	

2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business : 10000
ii. Hours :  1562 
iii. Category :  2643
iv. Attribute : 1115 
v. Review : id = 10000, business_id = 8090, user_id = 9581
vi. Checkin : 493
vii. Photo : id = 10000, business_id =  6493
viii. Tip : business_id = 3979, user_id = 537
ix. User : 10000
x. Friend : 11
xi. Elite_years : 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.

| Yuri   | -8lbUNlXVSoXqaRRiHiSNg |         1339 |
+--------+------------------------+--------------+		


8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	
In the first output (ordered by fans), a clear relationship can't be established since the number of reviews is independent of the number of fans. In the second output (ordered by review_count), that same relationship is maintained.
It should be taken into account that it is only possible to visualize a small percentage of the records (0.25%), so an inference about this is difficult.
Despite this, and with the results that can be visualized, it would seem that a clear relationship between fans and reviews can't be established.

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
City = Phoenix
Category = Restaurants              
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

By a few hours (difference of 6), the group of 2-3 stars shows more hours (24 hours) than the group of 4-5 stars (18 hours).

+---------+-------------+----------------------+-------+---------+---------+---------------------+-------+-------------+----------+-----------+---------+-------------+
| city    | category    | hours                | stars | reviews | city    | address             | state | postal_code | latitude | longitude | grouped | total_hours |
+---------+-------------+----------------------+-------+---------+---------+---------------------+-------+-------------+----------+-----------+---------+-------------+
| Phoenix | Restaurants | Saturday|5:00-0:00   |   2.0 |      56 | Phoenix | 1850 S 7th St       | AZ    | 85004       |  33.4297 |  -112.066 | 2_3     | 19          |
| Phoenix | Restaurants | Saturday|9:00-2:00   |   3.0 |     420 | Phoenix | 751 E Union Hls Dr  | AZ    | 85024       |  33.6536 |  -112.064 | 2_3     | 5           |
| Phoenix | Restaurants | Saturday|11:00-22:00 |   4.0 |    3017 | Phoenix | 3375 E Shea Blvd    | AZ    | 85028       |  33.5818 |  -112.008 | 4_5     | 11          |
| Phoenix | Restaurants | Saturday|11:00-18:00 |   4.5 |      49 | Phoenix | 1153 E Jefferson St | AZ    | 85034       |  33.4468 |  -112.057 | 4_5     | 7           |
+---------+-------------+----------------------+-------+---------+---------+---------------------+-------+-------------+----------+-----------+---------+-------------+


ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

Clearly in the table above, the group of 4-5 stars presents a greater number of reviews than the group of 2-3 stars.


iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

Nothing can be inferred regarding the location, since the addresses, latitude, longitude and postal codes are different and there is no relationship with the group of stars to which they belong (table above).


SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT b.city,
c.category,
h.hours,
b.stars,
SUM(b.review_count) AS reviews,
b.city, 
b.address,
b.state, 
b.postal_code, 
b.latitude, 
b.longitude,
CASE 
  WHEN (b.stars BETWEEN  2.0 AND 3.0) THEN '2_3'
  WHEN (b.stars BETWEEN  4.0 AND 5.0) THEN '4_5'
ELSE 'others'
END grouped,
CASE 
  WHEN h.hours LIKE '%5:00-0:00%' THEN '19'
  WHEN h.hours LIKE '%9:00-2:00%' THEN '5'
  WHEN h.hours LIKE '%11:00-22:00%' THEN '11'
  WHEN h.hours LIKE '%11:00-18:00%' THEN '7'
ELSE 'other'
END total_hours
FROM category c
INNER JOIN business b ON b.id = c.business_id
INNER JOIN hours h ON b.id = h.business_id
WHERE (b.city = 'Phoenix' AND c.category = 'Restaurants')
AND ((b.stars BETWEEN  2.0 AND 3.0) OR 
 (b.stars BETWEEN  4.0 AND 5.0))
GROUP BY b.stars
;

	
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
	
i. Difference 1:

The businesses that are open have more reviews on average than ones that are closed (avg_review column).	

+---------------+---------------+------------+
|    avg_review |     avg_stars | Open_Close |
+---------------+---------------+------------+
| 23.1980263158 | 3.52039473684 | Close      |
| 31.7570754717 | 3.67900943396 | Open       |
+---------------+---------------+------------+

ii. Difference 2:
  
The businesses that are open have more stars on average than ones that are closed (avg_stars column).	
  
SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT AVG(review_count) AS avg_review,
AVG(stars) AS avg_stars,
CASE
	WHEN is_open = 1 THEN 'Open'
	WHEN is_open = 0 THEN 'Close'
END Open_Close
FROM business
GROUP BY is_open
;

	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.
Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

The goal is to be able to predict the number of stars based on the comments. To make the prediction of the stars, a multiclass-classification model will be used in the future.

ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

To carry out the goal, the comments and the stars related to each commentary will be necessary. Both features will be selected from the "review" table.
The stars will be necessary because they are the target. The comments represent people's feelings. To be able to use the comments in a Machine Learning model, it will be necessary in a future task to extract the most important words from them (through Natural Language Processing with a library for it). 

iii. Output of your finished dataset:

Yelp Dataset SQL Lookup
Use the area below to run your queries against the Yelp dataset and fill out your worksheet (available in the Peer Review instructions):


IMPORTANT INFORMATION: the query output was limited to three records due to the large space it requires. Limit to 3 was only used to show a sample of the results. However, for the analysis the 10,000 registers would be used, like is shown in the SQL code in the following item.

|     4 | Red, white and bleu salad was super yum and a great addition to the menu! This location was clean with great service and food served at just the right temps! Kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos! When I'm on this side of town, this will definitely be a spot I'll hit up again! |
|     4 | Ate the momos during the momo crawl.. Was the best of the lot so decided to eat at the restaurant and the mutton thali was equally good!!                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|     5 | Pizza here made my night... Good people and great pizza. They can do anything you ask with a great attitude!                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
